# food_app

This is a recipe app. There are several pages, where you can insert the items you have available in your pantry/refrigerator, and then filter
recipes that you can cook based on the ingredients you have.

## Credits

I used TheMealDB for the recipe API, so all the premade recipes on here are from that.
For the widgets in the recipes, I used the Recipe_Card.dart code from Oflutter and made minor adjustments.
Here is the original video I used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlGTSb7_9jk&t=628s.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
